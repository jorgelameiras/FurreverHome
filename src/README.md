Furrever Home is a user-friendly website that gathers data on pets available for
adoption from n animal shelters in the Orlando area and creates a centralized page for
users to browse this information (n is a number still to be determined). The purpose of
this website is to provide a streamlined experience for matching cats and dogs available
for adoption with individuals looking to adopt. Our database will include pictures of the
dogs and cats, their breed, their age, their size, their gender, and their vaccination
status. Users of our platform can browse this database and filter their search based on
their preferences. The user has the option to create an account and log in order to save
pets to their list of favorites to revisit later. When a user finds a pet they might want to
adopt, they can get all the contact information they might need from that shelterâ€™s info
page. The information regarding the pets in our database will be added to the database
by the Admin. The shelters will send the admin the necessary information so that they
can do so. Our web page also includes an about us page to learn more about the
admin, and a FAQ page to answer any commonly asked questions.
