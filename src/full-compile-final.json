        "description": "Sadie's (A464854) day out from the shelter brought her some much needed respite from the noise and commotion. I've heard she's been overlooked for some time, but I found this girl to be the sweetest angel. She easily jumped in the car and enjoyed the scenery passing by as she sat at the window. In the backyard she ran and played with the toy but mostly wanted interaction from me. She gets excited but easily calms when asked. Sadie rolled in the grass enjoying the warm sun and light breeze. I thought I saw a smile to thank me. This girl loves to give kisses once she feels safe next to you!She's an excellent long walker and greets everyone who passes. At lunch with us she was perfect so she was treated with a doggie custard cone from Andy's. After the sugar high she rested in the chair with me capturing all the smells coming her way. We couldn't let her return to the shelter without a pup cup from Starbucks-an extra big one for this well behaved special girl.I heard Sadie snoring while on our way back. I couldn't be more thrilled to see her so relaxed dreaming of the fun day she experienced.Sadie's been waiting for her loving home for quite awhile. Please come visit  and fall in love with this gentle beautiful girl.This amazing pet qualifies for a reduced adoption fee as he/she has been in the shelter's care for four weeks or longer. This pet is eligible for adoption for $10, which includes the spay/neuter, initial vaccines and microchip identification.

        "description": "\"Zeus (A545934) was my favorite buddy for a Doggie Day Out. As part of a confiscation and later an owner surrender this big boy has experienced life at its worst but somehow is still the sweetest fun loving dog. He may be a senior, but his zest for activity is strong. He walked without pulling for a couple miles around the neighborhood. Zeus is the best  walker since it was his walk I let him sniff along the way.When it comes to food he will pull but can you blame him as he's so thin.  A special feeding plan has been initiated for weight gain. All his energy was used to walk around the backyard, chew on a bone and take in the warm sun. He even got a bath so now he smells so good. Later a trip to Twistee Treat allowed him to have his very own ice cream made for dogs. The day would not be complete without a stop for a pupcup. Zeus was exhausted on his way back to the shelter as he curled up beside me and rested his head on my lap and I stroked him to sleep. Zeus, with his fun goofy demeanor, made me happy that he enjoyed the day I planned for him. Once Zeus decompresses in an adoptive home he will curl up by YOUR side with his head in YOUR lap. Let's get this sweet boy home for the holidays.\"DG"

I know that is a really long time, more than half of my life. I am a great girl just ask anyone at the rescue center. I need time to get to know a person and trust them, but once I do, I will love you forever. I never forget those that love me. I am a little older now and really would just like a home that I can relax with my human. I am good on the leash, but really don't like going too far...but maybe if I had a great person to walk me and keep me safe, I would enjoy walking. I DO NOT like other animals (cats, dogs, birds, squirrels, etc), so my ideal home would need to be pet-free.... although I think I wouldn't mind a fish. I DO NOT like new people, so I would need a home that only has 1-2 ADULTS ONLY with very limited traffic in order to keep me and them safe. Please don't let any of this discourage you from wanting to adopt me. I know the right person is out there and the staff at the center is willing to work with us to ensure I get to the right home. It will take time for you to come in and meet me a few times, but I can guarantee I am worth it."

She will need time to transition and build trust. We have several dogs in our house and with a slow introduction, Avie did very well with them. Avie was rescued off the street by a family who helped get her into a better living situation. She was very shy when she came in and even shied away from being petted or touched in any way. Now she is so happy to get her backend scratched and pet. She wags her little crooked tail and gives kisses. She is good with cats and good with kids. We were told that she did not get along with dogs but believe it was the other dogs not liking her because she has gone on pack walks with several other dogs and done great. She has even gone into a foster with dogs of various ages and size with no issues. Avie is good on leash. She is playful, loves her toys, and is potty and crate trained."

I am not a fan of cats, sorry....kitties and me just do not mix, so I can't be in a home with cats. But, I do love, love, love people (including kids), riding in the car and I walk very nicely on leash, especially if we can walk for a long time. I go walking after I eat in the am... which is usually 6-6:30...and have 2 Poops...and only on my walks not in the yard.

Duke is very happy in his home and loves to explore the yard. He has discovered that Duke does not like to be left alone for very long. He does not tear things up or destroy anything, he just gets nervous and shakes when he's alone for an extended period of time. We would like his permanent home to have someone home most of the time (work from home or retired) to keep him company during the day. Since he does not do well meeting new people he should not be walked in a busy community where strangers might want to come up and pet him. He will either need a backyard where he can safely run and play or live somewhere there is minimal walking traffic."

        "description": "Hi there! My name is Cindy Crawford! Named after the supermodel, you can tell with how photogenic I am. I'm a playful little kitten with a curious spirit and a heart full of love. I might be a bit shy when we first meet, but once I warm up, you'll see just how much of a ball of energy I truly am. I have a sister who is my partner in crime! If you're looking for a purrfect companion, or at least a selfie buddy, I'm your gal! I've had all of my first year shots and have been neutered- this is included in my adoption fee. You will just have to take me to get established at my new vet within 30 days of adopting me. If you are interested in meeting me, please complete an adoption application. Upon pre-approval, someone will reach out to set up a time for you to come meet me! In addition to all first-year shots and my neuter, I have a registered microchip and a full set of medical records. Since kittens do best with having playmates and someone to cuddle with when our people aren't around, I will have to go to a home with other cats or kittens or even a dog (who likes cats of course). Or you could adopt a second kitten from Second Chance, at a greatly reduced adoption fee."

I would do best in a household with no cats and no children under 13. I can be a bit dog-selective. I will need pawrents who understand that I am shy and busy/loud environments make me very nervous. I will thrive in a stable environment, with a yard of my own. Walks are fine from time to time, but sometimes loud noises, falling leaves, or something out of place, like a repair van, make walks for me a bit stressful. Therefore, a fenced-in yard will be required to adopt me. I've had all my shots, I've been neutered, and am ready to go home.

I also know what they mean when they tell me to pee or poop on a walk, these are just the beginnings of words that I am learning, and I can (and want to) learn so much more! My favorite afternoon past-time is laying in the sun soaking up the rays (although this is Florida, so that only lasts about 10 minutes). I would benefit most from a home with someone VERY active and would like to take the time to train me on many more commands. The sky is the limit as to what I can learn. I do get along with other dogs (with slow introductions), but I am also very intense, so it depends on whether the other dog is willing and able to set boundaries for me. I require slow introductions to people as well, you can't just trust everyone. Since I am young, and strong, it would be best to be in a home without children. I love to go on walks, but love yard zoomies as well, so a fenced-in yard is preferred. I am a bit of a handful, so we don't want anyone to think they are entering into this lightly with me. I will need love, time and lots of training to be the best dog I can be. In return, you will have my loyalty and love, I'm a very wonderful companion. No DNA tests have been done, but since Cattle Dog and possibly Blue Nose Pit are both on the restricted breed list, homeownership is required to adopt me. No renters. I have all had all of my shots, and am spayed. This is all included in my adoption fee, as well as a registered microchip and a full set of medical records for you and my future vet!

        "description": "Hi! I'm Pooky Bear, I'm a sweet and cuddly guy, I get along very well with all the other cats and kittens in the kitten room, you can find me snuggling all the time. I have already had all my rounds of shots and boosters and best of all I am already neutered. It is as easy as falling in love with me and taking me to my permanent home! Heads up, I am special needs because I am FIV positive. I can live very amicably with other cats and kittens, the only thing is, I'm more susceptible to getting sick. Here at Second Chance, they help me boost my immune system by sprinkling L-Lysine on my food, so overall, I'm a pretty healthy and totally sweet guy! If you are interested in meeting me, please complete an adoption application. Upon pre-approval, someone will reach out to set up a time for you to come meet us! In addition to all first-year shots and neuter, I come with a registered microchip and a full set of medical records."

        "description": "Hi, my name is Trooper. I would benefit most from a home with someone active and would like to take the time to play with me and take me on lots of walks. In return, you will have my loyalty and love, I'm a very wonderful companion. I love taking a toy with me on all my walks, it makes me feel safe. Not to mention, I look extremely cute carrying it around don't you think? I do get along with other dogs and am very friendly to humans. I'm young and smart and will need some impulse training, but I aim to please. I have all had all of my shots, and am neutered. This is all included in my adoption fee, as well as a registered microchip and a full set of medical records for you and my future vet! If you are interested in meeting me, please complete an adoption application. Upon pre-approval, someone will reach out to set up a time for a meet and greet. I'm looking forward to meeting you! Only applicants who meet the following current requirements will be considered: - Homeownership, no renters - Children in the home must be 13 and up - Fenced yard not required, but preferred"

        "description": "Hi there, I'm Ursula. Not to be confused with the gorgeous sea witch herself. I might not have magical powers, but I do have a knack for casting spells... of cuteness! I love \"swimming\" through cozy blankets, pouncing on my \"sea creatures\" (aka toys), and curling up right into your lap. If your wish is to have a cuddly kitten at home then I'm your gal. Just got to sign the contract (I promise there's no catch to mine) and then I can promise you the endless purrs, snuggles, and a splash of sass. I've had all of my first year shots and have been neutered- this is included in my adoption fee. You will just have to take me to get established at my new vet within 30 days of adopting me. If you are interested in meeting me, please complete an adoption application. Upon pre-approval, someone will reach out to set up a time for you to come meet me! In addition to all first-year shots and my neuter, I have a registered microchip and a full set of medical records. Since kittens do best with having playmates and someone to cuddle with when our people aren't around, I will have to go to a home with other cats or kittens or even a dog (who likes cats of course). Or you could adopt a second kitten from Second Chance, at a greatly reduced adoption fee."
